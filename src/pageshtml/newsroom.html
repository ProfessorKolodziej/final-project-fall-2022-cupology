            <h2>Air Pollution-Related Hospitalization for Chest Pain, Heart Attack Differed by Seasons</h2>
            <p class="article-info">American Heart Association | 06 November 2023</p>

                mountain valley region of Utah were associated with increased health care visits for heart attack and
                unstable chest pain; however, the risk for each cardiac event differed by season, according to a
                preliminary study to be presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2023.</p>
